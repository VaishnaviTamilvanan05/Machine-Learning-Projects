Our approach includes rigorous data preprocessing and feature engineering techniques such as cyclical encoding for time-based features and feature scaling to normalize data distributions. We have trained and fine-tuned Random Forest, XGBoost, and CatBoost Regression models, focusing on optimizing hyperparameters to minimize the Root Mean Squared Logarithmic Error (RMSLE), which is the primary evaluation metric for this competition. Based on the models with the lowest RMSLE scores, we predict the count of bike rentals for each datetime in the test dataset and prepare the submission file, which is saved in the

Therefore, we have chosen the XGBoost model as our preferred method for predicting the count of bike rentals for each datetime in the test dataset.
