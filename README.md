## Key Features:
1. Data Analysis: This project involves an in-depth analysis of user data, which includes factors such as user ratings and reviews. The analysis aims to identify patterns and trends in user behavior to optimize product recommendations.

2. Net Promoter Score (NPS): The project calculates the Net Promoter Score (NPS) to gauge user satisfaction and loyalty, which further informs the recommendation algorithm.

3. Text Normalization Techniques: To improve the quality of recommendations, the system utilizes advanced text normalization techniques, including stemming and lemmatization, to process and extract meaningful information from user-generated text data, such as product reviews.

4. Sentiment Analysis: Real-time sentiment analysis is performed using the Twitter API to capture public sentiment and opinions about products. This sentiment analysis provides valuable insights into how products are perceived in the market and allows for more accurate and timely product recommendations.

5. Recommendation Algorithm: The project employs a Random Forest classifier to generate personalized product recommendations. The algorithm takes into account user ratings, NPS, and sentiment analysis results to suggest products that align with individual user preferences and market sentiment.

The E-Commerce Recommendation System with Sentiment Analysis is a cutting-edge solution that not only enhances the user experience but also provides actionable insights into product perception in the market. By combining data analysis, sentiment analysis, and machine learning, this project offers a powerful tool for e-commerce platforms to increase user satisfaction and boost sales.
